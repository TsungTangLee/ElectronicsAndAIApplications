# Implementation CNN By Tensorflow For CIFAR-10 classification.
[Step 1] Setup Environment : Use Google Colab GPU

[Step 2] Load Data

[Step 3] Data Preprocessing

[Step 4] Implement CNN By Tensorflow

[Step 5] Train Model By Two Approaches : earlystop and no earlystop (Save best performance model)

=> keras_cifar10_trained_model.h5


[Step 6] Score Model By Accuracy And Loss

[Step 7] Plot Accuracy And Loss Performances
